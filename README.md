Hierarchical Time Series Analysis. Predicting whether countries would achieve goals at a certain time t, by hierarchically examining a number of indicators benchmarked against predefined thresholds. 

United Nation gathers statistical information from different countries about different economic, social and cultural indicators. Then this information is used to assess a countires progress towards achieving certain goals. Now, Inorder for a country to achieve a certain goal, It must have met certain Targets, Inorder to meet those targets, it must have met certain indicators.Hierarchical Time Series Analysis.
